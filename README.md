# AllThingsGaucho

An Android app that allows members of the UCSB community to log into their ATG accounts, and offer/ pickup rideshares, sell/ buy items, and pay for the rideshare and/or items using the inbuilt payment portal.

The app uses Firebase to create and authenticate user login, as well as for database needs for querying rideshare and marketplace requests.

Built using Java on Android Studio.
